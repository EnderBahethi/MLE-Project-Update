Update on current Progress with MLE Project
Hello My name is Ender, I am making a Rizz Calculator to attempt to qualitatively determine everyone's Rizz on campus.

Specifically I have created a google form to create a data set that I will run a linear regression algorithm in order to determine Rizz of a user. Rizz in this context will be the aggregate scores of the biases around the users life choices. This is for educational purposes and should not be used out side of entertainment. It has not bearing on the real world and should not be relied upon for anything.
